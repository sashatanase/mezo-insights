# Insights-repository 
A unified repository for all our research insights—from usability studies to market feedback.

It serves as a central source of truth for both Product and Marketing, helping us capture patterns, themes, and quotes across all user touchpoints.

Our goal is not just to archive insights, but to build a growing, structured, and reusable dataset that informs design, messaging, and growth strategies.

# 🧠 Mezo Insights Repository

This is the central repository for storing, generating, and reviewing user research insights from PDF interviews and other raw materials.

Insights are extracted using **Claude**, optionally scripted for automation, and pushed here for structured storage, tagging, and reuse across teams.
